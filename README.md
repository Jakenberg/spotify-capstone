# Spotify Capstone Project
This project is used for a capstone project for an extension class that I took at
some high profile public college in Los Angeles.

As my own music tastes have matured, I started to grow old of the music that Spotify was recommending me. Seriously, Spotify always plays LCD Soundsystem after a playlist ends. I basically hate LCD Soundsystem now. Did I really listen to that much LCD Soundsystem? I couldn't have.

Anywho, as part of my mission to discover new music and as part of a larger journey to become digitally polyglottal, I figured I could "grab a few fruit for the same price": explore some data, work on my programming knowledge, discover new music. Since music is such a large part of my daily routine I decided that, for my project, I'd leverage the Spotify API to accomplish all of these tasks.

Fortunately for me, there is a ton of information online that leverages the
Spotify API. The class itself is focused more on analysis over coding capabilities, therefore, I decided that it wouldn't
be against any rules to lift some code from other projects. Out of respect for the author of the code that I initially lifted
most heavily from, I chose to fork their repository into my own public repository. I need to reach out to them to see
if that was ok to do. I will update this when I know more. Yea, I guess it's a little rude to do this without asking
for "permission" but it's a public repo. You'd eat a sandwich you saw laying down on a public park bench wouldn't you?
Ok that's a poor metaphor. The point is, we're all riding the same bus, learning from each other, and sharing from each other as
well. Maybe one day, someone will like what I did here and fork this repository. That'd be a pretty cool thing to put on my CV
wouldn't you agree? Anyway, I will update this README as I continue on this project. I intend to foster it further and am not
particularly interested in pretending like I didn't need some help along the way.
